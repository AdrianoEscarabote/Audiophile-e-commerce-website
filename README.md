## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Axios
- React Loading Skeleton
- Redux
- Typescript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

This is without a doubt my biggest and best project so far. I am very pleased with the result and believe that I did a good job. During development, I faced many challenges in using technologies with which I didn't have much experience, but it was very rewarding to overcome them.

I am still learning to use all the features of Next.js and I am excited to explore them. One technology that I am particularly passionate about is Redux, which was crucial for the shopping cart functionality in the project. Although I know that Redux Toolkit is simpler, I decided to first learn pure Redux and do not regret that choice.
